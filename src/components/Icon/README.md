# Icon

Shows one icon: from Material Symbols, always in the **Rounded** style with **Fill** on, or one of your own custom icons. Use it on its own or pass an icon name straight to Button's `leftIcon`, `rightIcon` or `icon`.

```jsx
const { Icon, Button } = window.Serupa;

<Icon name="home" />                       // 24px, decorative
<Icon name="warning" size={20} style={{ color: 'var(--warning)' }} />
<Icon name="error" aria-label="Error" />   // meaningful: announced as "Error"
<Button leftIcon="add">New project</Button>
<Button variant="ghost" icon="settings" aria-label="Settings" />
```

## When to use

- A symbol next to a label that helps people find it quickly: in buttons, menus, list rows and navigation.
- A status (success, warning, error, info) next to the message it belongs to.
- A large symbol in an empty state or an illustration.

## When not to use

- A button that shows only an icon: use [IconButton](../IconButton/README.md) instead; it requires the label an icon alone doesn't have.
- A photo, a screenshot or any other picture: use [Image](../Image/README.md) instead.
- A person's or team's picture: use [Avatar](../Avatar/README.md) instead.

## Usage

Find names in the Material Symbols catalog (Rounded style) at fonts.google.com/icons; the font is already here, only the names come from the catalog. Names are lowercase with underscores: `arrow_forward`, `more_vert`.

- Use Material Symbols Rounded, filled, and custom icons drawn to the same rules. Don't mix in other icon sets or the Outlined/Sharp styles.
- Before drawing a custom icon, check that Material Symbols doesn't already have one for that meaning.
- One icon per meaning across the product: `delete`, not `delete` in one place and `remove` in another.

### Setup

Nothing to load: the font ships with the system as `fonts/MaterialSymbolsRounded-Filled.woff2`, and `tokens.css` declares it with `font-display: block`, so a name never flashes as a word while the font loads. It holds only the filled, weight-400 Rounded style, with optical sizes from 20 to 48.

The font is cut to the icons the system uses: every name on the Foundations/Icons page and every name the components and docs use, about 270 icons in 55 KB. Any other name shows as its letters. To use any Material Symbols name, load the full font (about 1 MB) after the tokens:

```css
@import "serupa-ds/tokens.css";
@import "serupa-ds/fonts/icons-full.css";
```

In this repository, run `python3 tools/icons/subset.py` after using a new name anywhere in `src/`, `docs/` or `.storybook/`; the icon test fails until you do.

### Custom icons

For what Material Symbols doesn't have, add your own SVG icons. They work everywhere a Material Symbols name does, with the same sizes, colors and accessibility:

```jsx
<Icon name="serupa-sparkle" />
<Button leftIcon="serupa-sparkle">Generate</Button>
```

**Draw** each icon so it sits with Material Symbols Rounded:

- A 24×24 frame (`viewBox="0 0 24 24"`) with about 2px of padding around the shape.
- Filled shapes with rounded corners and ends, like the Rounded style. Outlined (stroke) icons work too, at a 2px stroke.
- One color. The build draws every shape in the text color, so icons follow the theme. Parts that should show the background must be holes (a cut-out path, or `fill-rule="evenodd"`), not white shapes.
- Only shapes: outline text and flatten masks, gradients and effects before exporting. Figma's "Export as SVG" and Illustrator's "Export As SVG" both work.

**Add** them:

1. Put the SVG in `assets/Icons/` (the Icons set on the design system page). The file name is the icon's name: lowercase letters and digits, words joined by `-` or `_`, such as `serupa-sparkle.svg`. A prefix such as `serupa-` keeps your names apart from Material Symbols; a custom icon with the same name as a Material Symbol replaces it everywhere.
2. Run `python3 tools/icons/build.py` (or `python3 tools/icons/build.py path/to/folder`). It writes the icons into `components/bundle.js` and their names into `components/index.d.ts` (`CustomIconName`), so TypeScript autocompletes them.
3. Run it again after changing or removing a file. `python3 tools/icons/build.py --check` fails if the components are out of step, for CI.

The build keeps only the shapes and removes editor leftovers (ids, classes, sizes, Figma and Illustrator metadata). It refuses a file, with the reason, when it holds anything that could run code or load something (scripts, event handlers, links, images), anything that isn't a plain shape (text, gradients, masks, filters, `<use>`), another grid, or a second color. A refused file stops the build, and the components stay as they were.

`Serupa.customIcons` lists the custom icons' names.

### Sizes

The same for Material Symbols and custom icons.

| Size | Use | Optical size |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 14px | Inside `sm` buttons | 20 |
| 16px | Inside `md` buttons, inline with `text-sm` | 20 |
| 20px | Inside `lg` buttons, list rows, inputs | 20 |
| 24px | Default: toolbars, navigation, standalone | 24 |
| 40px+ | Empty states, illustrations | 40–48 |

The optical size is the font's own: the browser picks it from the icon's size (`font-optical-sizing: auto`), so small icons get slightly bolder strokes and large ones finer detail. Nothing in the system overrides it.

### Color

Icons take the text color (`currentColor`). Set it with an alias, never a palette color: `text` or `text-muted` for neutral icons, and `success`, `warning`, `danger` or `info` for status icons. Icons that carry meaning need 3:1 contrast against their background.

### Common icons

| Action | Name |
| --- | --- |
| Create / add | `add` |
| Edit | `edit` |
| Delete | `delete` |
| Close | `close` |
| Search | `search` |
| Settings | `settings` |
| More | `more_vert`, `more_horiz` |
| Next / back | `arrow_forward`, `arrow_back` |
| Menu open | `expand_more`, `chevron_right` |
| Success / error / warning / info | `check_circle`, `error`, `warning`, `info` |

## Accessibility

- **Role and name:** icons are decorative by default (`aria-hidden`). Give an icon an `aria-label` only when it's the sole carrier of meaning, such as a status icon without text. With `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` it becomes `role="img"` with that name.
- **Next to text:** leave it decorative; the text already says what it means.
- **Icon-only buttons:** the button needs the name, not the icon: pass `aria-label` to the Button, or use [IconButton](../IconButton/README.md), which requires a `label`.
- **Contrast:** icons that carry meaning need 3:1 against their background (see Color, under Usage).
- **Translation:** a Material Symbols icon is its name written in the icon font, so it has `translate="no"` to keep translation tools from changing the name and breaking the icon.

## Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | `IconName`: a custom icon's name or a Material Symbols name (any name with `fonts/icons-full.css`) | | Required. A custom icon with the same name as a Material Symbol wins. Custom names autocomplete. |
| `size` | `number \| string` | 24px, or the button's icon size inside a Button | Pixels as a number, or any CSS length. Sets the font size; the icon is 1em square. |
| `aria-label` | `string` | | Makes the icon meaningful: `role="img"` with this name. Without it (or `aria-labelledby`) the icon is `aria-hidden`. |

`className`, `style`, `ref` and other `<span>` props go to the outer `<span>`. Custom icons have `data-icon` with their name.

## Component tokens

None: it draws in `currentColor` at 1em of its font size, so it takes its color from the text and its size from `size` or the text around it.
