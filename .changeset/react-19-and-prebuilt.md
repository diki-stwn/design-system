- Added: React 19 support. CI type-checks, runs the component tests and server-renders every component on React 19 as well as 18. The peer dependency is now `^18.0.0 || ^19.0.0`.
- Fixed: Menu, Popover and Tooltip no longer warn on React 19 when their trigger has a ref (they read it as a prop there).
- Changed: `RadioGroup`'s `onChange` and `Slider`'s `onValueChange` and `onValueCommit` are typed instead of `any`. RadioGroup takes the value type from `value` or `onChange` (`string | number` unless you say), and Slider gives `number` for one thumb or `[number, number]` for a range. Code that relied on `any`, such as passing the value straight to a `useState<string>` setter without a typed `value`, may need a type now. `SliderValue` is exported.
- Changed: Release tags are prebuilt. Each tag points at a release commit made off `main` that carries `dist/` and a `package.json` without scripts or devDependencies, so `npm install github:diki-stwn/serupa-ds#vX.Y.Z` copies files and builds nothing.
